In this file I started experimenting with Monte Carlo simulations for the first time with a simple scenario. 

Obviously, this is not so useful since its a portfolio with only two stocks and I only ran one simulation. I plan to automate this in python and run perhaps 1000 simulations and get an average portfolio value. 

After that, I will add more assets to the portfolio, and also experiment with crypto.
